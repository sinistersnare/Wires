# Wires #

This is a simplistic spiderman-physics game based off of
[Double Wires](http://www.freewebarcade.com/game/double-wires/).
That game is definitely better, so probably play that instead.

## Build ##

1. Make sure you have SDL2 installed (`$ brew install sdl2` on MacOS)
2. Make sure you have SDL2_image installed (`$ brew install sdl2_image` on MacOS)
3. Make sure you have other SDL2_* i havent mentioned that might happen (check compile errors...)
3. `$ stack build` Will build the executable and put it in a folder specified by the output
4. /that/exe/output/folder/wires should get it working...

If that does not work, then I need to fix the build process, because it should be _that_ simple.

## Goals ##

* Recreate the wire physics
* Have some sort of level system

## Non Goals ##

* Ragdoll physics

These goals are extremely flexible, so who knows what this will end up as...

Anyways, thanks for looking!
